# Intrduction:
This is a heathcare domain's Lungs cancer prediction project,where i have used Logistic regression model for training classifier model.


# Technologies used:
sklearn,fastapi,pandas,numpy,matplotlib,docker,github-actions


# Description:
here i have created a machine learning model using sklearn which can predict weather the patient is having a lungs cancer or not.where i have used fastapi to build a application,docker for containerization and github-actions for continous integration and continous devlopment and heroku is used as deployment-server.
